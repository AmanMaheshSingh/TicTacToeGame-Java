# Tic Tac Toe (Java Console)

A console-based Tic Tac Toe game in Java — built as part of a learn-in-public project.

## Features
- 1v1: Player vs Player
- PvC (Easy): Computer plays random moves
- PvC (Medium): Computer tries to win or block, otherwise random
- PvC (Hard): Unbeatable AI using **Minimax**
- Clean console UI and robust input handling
- (Day 7) Session scoreboard to count wins and draws

## How to run
1. Clone repo: https://github.com/AmanMaheshSingh/TicTacToeGame-Java
2. Compile: TicTacToe
3. Run: TicTacToe


## Development Roadmap
- Day 1: Board setup
- Day 2: Player input
- Day 3: Win detection
- Day 4: Replay loop
- Day 5: Mode selection + easy AI
- Day 6: Smart AI + Minimax (Hard)
- Day 7: Score counters + final polish (this repo)

## Notes
- Minimax implementation is CPU-bound for 3x3 board and runs instantly on modern machines.
- The AI plays `O` in PvC modes. To make computer play `X`, small adjustments are required.
